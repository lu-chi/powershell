Several basic template scripts I was using everyday for managing VMs and some apps installations inventory.
More scripts to come soon.

Scan-Folder: script I made to control shared folder for remotely scanned documents. I've noticed several times my scanned documents disappearing or used by others. This scripts monitors the scanner source folder and once the file (with specified "coded" name) found - script moves it to the desired destination.

CreateTomcatInstance: just a simple concept of a script to perform new Tomcat instance.
