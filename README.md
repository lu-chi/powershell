Several basic template scripts I was using everyday for managing VMs and some apps installations inventory.
More scripts will be commited soon.

scan-folder: script I made to control shared folder for scanned documents. I've noticed several times my remotely scanned documents disappearing or used by others.

CreateTomcatInstance: just a simple concept of a script to perform new Tomcat instance.
